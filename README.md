# Austin Animal Center Analysis


## Project Outline
Our project is to uncover patterns of behaviors related to abandonded pets entering the Austin Animal Center.  We will examine the kinds of animals entering the facility, the frequency they are being admitted and the reasons why.  We will establish any trends or patterns based on gender, age, breed, etc. Weâ€™ll also look into the outcomes of these intakes - adoption, euthanasia, returned to owner, etc.
